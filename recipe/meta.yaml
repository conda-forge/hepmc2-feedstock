  summary: HepMC - a C++ Event Record for Monte Carlo Generators

  description: |
    The HepMC package is an object oriented, C++ event record
    for High Energy Physics Monte Carlo generators and simulation.
    The original code was written by M. Dobbs and J.B. Hansen
     (Comput. Phys. Commun. 134 (2001) 41). Since the first 
    implementation, the package has undergone several modifications
    and in particular, the latest HepMC3 series is a completely new
    re-write using currently available C++11 techniques.
